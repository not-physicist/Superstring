\section{Two-dimensional gravity}
To show that in two dimension the energy momentum tensor vanishes identically, one needs to show $T_{\mu\nu} \propto R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} = 0$.

In two dimension, Riemann tensor $R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}$ can only have one non-zero component because of its symmetries. Its skew symmetry makes the Riemann tensor to be zero, if its indices are not combination of two $0$s and two $1$s. Reason is simple: otherwise one could use the skew symmetry, so that $R_{\mu\nu\alpha \beta} = -R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} = 0$. As a matter of fact, the only non-vanishing components are $R_{0101} = -R_{1001} = -R_{0110} = R_{1010}$, i.e.~first and second pair indices must contain $0$ and $1$. Then the Ricci tensor is
\begin{align*}
	R_{\mu\nu} &= g^{\alpha \beta }R_{\alpha\mu\beta\nu}  \\
				  &= g^{00} R_{0\mu0\nu} + g^{11} R_{1\mu1\nu} + g^{01} R_{0\mu1\nu} + g^{10} R_{1\mu0\nu}\\
				  &= \begin{pmatrix} g^{11} & -g^{01} \\ -g^{01} & g^{00} \end{pmatrix} R_{0101} \\
				  &= g g_{\mu\nu} R_{0101}
\end{align*}
Here we express the metric with its inverse metric
\begin{equation*}
	g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{\det g^{\mu\nu}}  \begin{pmatrix} g^{11} & -g^{01} \\ -g^{01} & g^{00} \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}

The Ricci scalar is then
\begin{equation*}
	R = g^{\mu\nu} R_{\mu\nu}  = 2 g R_{0101}
\end{equation*}

Thus
\begin{equation}
	R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} = g g_{\mu\nu} R_{0101} - gg_{\mu\nu} R_{0101} = 0
\end{equation}
Then the energy momentm tensor vanishes identically.
